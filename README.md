# Water-Level-Indicator
The Water Level Indicator is an IC-based electronic system designed using Proteus software to monitor water levels in tanks. It uses LEDs to indicate low, medium, and high levels, making it ideal for preventing overflow or depletion in domestic and industrial water storage systems. The system ensures efficient and reliable water management.
At the heart of this project is its IC-based circuitry, which provides reliable monitoring of water levels. The system uses visual indicators, such as LEDs, to represent different water levels, including low, medium, and high thresholds. In addition to displaying the water level, the system is equipped with an automatic motor control feature. When the water level drops below the lowest threshold, the motor automatically turns on to start filling the tank. Conversely, when the water reaches the highest level, the motor automatically turns off, preventing overflow.

This functionality makes the Water Level Indicator ideal for both domestic and industrial applications. In households, it prevents water wastage by ensuring that tanks are refilled only when necessary. In industrial settings, it offers reliable monitoring and automated control of large-scale water reservoirs. The system is also well-suited for integration into automated water supply systems, where it can regulate the operation of water pumps based on real-time water levels, thus optimizing water usage and conservation.

The use of Proteus software in the design and simulation phase allows for accurate testing of the entire circuit before physical implementation, ensuring the system's reliability and efficiency.

In summary, the Water Level Indicator is a versatile and efficient solution for both monitoring and controlling water levels in storage systems. Its combination of IC-based design, automatic motor control, and Proteus simulation makes it a robust and reliable tool for various water management applications.
